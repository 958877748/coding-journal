About a week ago I got a Microsoft Band 2. I really wanted to try out the device, because this second generation does not look as bad as the first one, there are new sensors added and generally it should be a visible improvement over the original Band. I have been an iPhone users for about two years now (approximately the time since last good Windows Phone device was released), currently using iPhone 6s so I was also curious to know how well the Band 2 works with iOS. This blog post sums up my impressions after a week of using the Microsoft Band 2 with my iPhone.

**Expectations and habits**

First I have to state that I am not a notifications junkie. I do not like being interrupted all the time. On my iPhone, only phone calls and SMS ale allowed to notify me with a sound and stay in the notifications center. Other few selected apps like Outlook, Twitter, Messenger, Sunrise are allowed to use badges on my iPhone, just to let me know that there is a Twitter message or something I may want to be interested in. Other than that, no notifications for me. I guess I am not a typical user when it comes to notifications.

As you may have already guessed, I was interested in the Microsoft Band 2 primarily as a health device, not as a smartwatch or distractions device. My expectations and goal is to move and exercise more and sleep better, not to immediately know about every new Facebook post (I do not even have the Facebook app installed).

**Look and feel**

I always thought the first Microsoft Band was big, bulky and did not look very good. The Band 2 is nicer, the area around the display is not as bulky, the main mass of the device was move to the other side. This kind of makes you wear the device with the display inside your wrist, "military style", the opposite of how you usually wear a watch. Event the guy in a video ad I saw wore it this way. This allows a neat feature, having the watch face come up when you turn your wrist.

The device feels solid, I did not feel uncomfortable wearing. I though using the keyboard while wearing it maybe be a problem and it partially was. I could use the keyboard while using my desktop computer, but I had to be careful not to scratch the display on the edge when using my Thinkpad notebook. 

**Initial setup**

After I installed the Microsoft Health app on my iPhone, the pairing was quick without any problems. The app installed a firmware updated to the Band 2 while pairing. The next day the Microsoft Health app was updated and it updated the firmware in the Band 2 again. This time  the firmware update brought two new functions: controlling the music playback and inactivity reminder. I do not much care about the music control, I listen only to podcasts and it did not work with the podcast app. Inactivity reminder is a great feature, reminding you to wake up and take a few steps when sitting idle for a long time. I really do not know why this function was not in the Band from the beginning. 

**Microsoft Health and iOS**

Microsoft Health is the app you use to configure and manage your Band. It has a "windowsy" look and feel event on iOS (including messed up margins on some screens). It can import data from the iOS Health app, so it can show you number of steps that the iPhone records. But it cannot export the data back to iOS Health. This means that data like the data about your sleep can be accessed only from the Microsoft Health app and are not propagated to other iOS app that can import data from iOS Health. 

You can connect the Microsoft Health app to the Microsoft Health vault, which has a nice web dashboard. This dashboard is more detailed and more simple to use that the app in the phone. But you have to be ok with your data being exported to some Microsoft data center.

There are not many 3rd party iOS apps, except big fitness apps like Strava, that can use the Band, but this is not a surprise. Band apps are maybe the only platform where Windows Phone has an advantage. Also there are not so many Web Tiles available, except for a couple of sports tiles made by the Bing team.

Steps and basic tracking

Band track steps and supposedly uses the iPhone to help with that. It also shows you distance traveled, steps climbed, calories burnt.

Sleep tracking

Notifications

I set the Band to show me notifications about incoming calls and SMS, nothing more. When a notifications is invoke, the Band vibrates. The default medium intensity is not very intense, so I had to set it to high to be aware of it. When you receive a SMS, the band can "read" it to you by showing it on the screen quickly, so you do not have to scroll. 

I did not bother to set up notifications for other apps. But the Microosft Health app also offered me notifications for Calendar, Facebook, Facebook Messegner, Twitter and a generic one called Notifications Center. 

Annoyances

All the notifications and all the data are take from the phone and not really configurable. There is one thing that got me really annoyed when I discovered it. The iOS calendar app creates a calendar of peoples' birthdays. I have this calendar turned of in the iOS Calendar app and also in Sunrise, my calendar app of choice. But the Band does not respect this settings and also there is not configuration possible. So your calendar gets littered with birthdays and possible birthday notifications and there is nothing that you can do about it. Except disabling the calendar functionality on the Band. I know, I contacted Microsoft support (half an hour with probably an Indian guy, no solution, just my heart rate rising - Band told me).
