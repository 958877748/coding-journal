**Igor Kulman** is currently working as Windows Phone and Windows developer, also building applications for Microsoft Azure and playing with F#. Interested in programming languages, functional programming and data science.

This blog mostly covers my programming experience dealing with Windows Phone and Windows development. You can also find some rants here, because I do not like when stuff breaks.
